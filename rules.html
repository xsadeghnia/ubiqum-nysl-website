                                     That player will be suspended from playing in the next game in which the offending participant would
                                      otherwise be eligible to participate. This process will continue so that for every third yellow card 
                                      received during a playing year, the player will be suspended from playing in the next game
                                       (after the receipt of a third yellow card) for which the offending participate would otherwise be
                                        eligible to participate. The referee shall deliver all confiscated passes to the UYSA State Office 
                                        within forty-eight (48) hours of the conclusion of the match.
